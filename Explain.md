# Stock Movement Prediction Based on Social Media Sentiment

This project predicts stock price movements by analyzing sentiment from social media discussions, such as tweets. Below is an explanation of the process: **data scraping**, **preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.

## 1. Data Scraping

### Objective:
The first step involves collecting social media data to understand the sentiment around specific stocks or companies. In this project, Twitter was used as the data source, leveraging the Twitter API.

### Process:
- Use the Twitter API to fetch recent tweets related to a company or stock (e.g., Tesla or Tata Consultancy Services).
- Focus on specific keywords, hashtags, or topics to narrow the search.
- Extract relevant metadata, such as the tweet content and timestamp, for further analysis.

### Challenges:
- Managing API rate limits when scraping large amounts of data.
- Filtering noise or irrelevant tweets to maintain the quality of the dataset.

## 2. Preprocessing

### Objective:
Clean and prepare the raw data to make it suitable for sentiment analysis and predictive modeling.

### Process:
- **Text Cleaning:** Remove URLs, mentions, special characters, and redundant text like "RT" prefixes. Normalize text by converting it to lowercase.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis tool (e.g., NLTK's Vader) to score the sentiment of each tweet. The sentiment score quantifies whether a tweet conveys positive, negative, or neutral emotions.

### Challenges:
- Handling tweets with ambiguous or sarcastic language, which can affect sentiment accuracy.
- Ensuring that non-English tweets are filtered or translated appropriately for analysis.

## 3. Model Training

### Objective:
Train a machine learning model to predict stock price movements ("Up" or "Down") based on sentiment scores and other features.

### Process:
- Combine sentiment scores with stock price movement data to create a labeled dataset.
- Use supervised learning techniques, such as classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest), to map sentiment scores to stock movement predictions.
- Split the data into training and test sets to ensure unbiased evaluation.

### Challenges:
- Aligning social media sentiment data with corresponding stock price movements in time.
- Balancing the dataset to prevent the model from being biased toward frequent outcomes (e.g., "Up").

## 4. Model Evaluation

### Objective:
Evaluate the performance of the trained model and ensure its predictions are reliable.

### Process:
- Use metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** to assess the model's performance.
- Visualize predictions and errors to identify potential improvement areas.
- Analyze the importance of features (e.g., sentiment scores) to understand their impact on predictions.

### Challenges:
- Achieving high accuracy while minimizing false positives/negatives, as both types of errors can have significant consequences in stock trading.
- Incorporating more advanced metrics to evaluate financial predictions effectively, such as profitability or risk-adjusted returns.

## Future Improvements

### Suggestions:
1. **Data Sources:** Expand data collection to include other platforms like Reddit (e.g., r/stocks) or Telegram groups focused on stock discussions.
2. **Advanced Models:** Use deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs or Transformers) for more nuanced sentiment analysis.
3. **Additional Features:** Incorporate features such as trading volume, market trends, or news sentiment for improved accuracy.
4. **Real-Time Predictions:** Develop a pipeline to process live data and provide real-time stock movement predictions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical approach to predicting stock movements using social media sentiment. While the initial results are promising, there is significant scope for enhancing the model by integrating diverse data sources and exploring advanced techniques.
