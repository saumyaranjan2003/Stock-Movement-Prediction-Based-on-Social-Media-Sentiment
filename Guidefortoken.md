## Step 5: Secure Your API Keys
- Do not expose your API keys in public repositories or code files.
- Use environment variables or secure storage solutions to keep them confidential.

## Example: Using Your API Keys
Once you have generated the keys, store them in a `.env` file or environment variables, and access them in your Python project like this:

### `.env` File:
```plaintext
TWITTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
TWITTER_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token
```
